Host the Web Application:

    You can host the Flask app using a web server like Nginx or Apache. Configure the web server to proxy requests to your Flask app.

Security:

    Implement user authentication and authorization using Flask's built-in features or third-party libraries like Flask-Login and Flask-Security.
    Secure your Raspberry Pi and web application by following best practices for server security.

Access from Anywhere:

    Ensure your Raspberry Pi is accessible from the internet by configuring port forwarding on your mobile hotspot router. You may also consider using a dynamic DNS service like No-IP to obtain a hostname that dynamically maps to your mobile hotspot's IP address.

Monitoring:

    Implement logging using Python's built-in logging module to track errors and application events.
    Monitor the performance of your web application using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.

Testing:

    Thoroughly test your web application by running it on your Raspberry Pi and accessing it from different devices and networks.

Scaling:

    Depending on your project's requirements, you can scale your setup by adding data storage, implementing historical data analysis using databases, and creating more advanced data visualizations using libraries like Plotly or Matplotlib.
